text is in OAM sprites:

6015800
 from 82EB052 (probably font), RLUnComp
 at 80244C8
 
80244B4, r0 is character being printed
 call right before this converts r0 from SJS to simple char code

802451A, r1 is char, loaded from r0

first txt at 806B0A4

figuring out control codes:

<$65><$65>:

occurs at 806B0C0

6565 seems like a long pause
6C6C seems like a short pause

6565 is always followed by 0000, 0000 is never read by the game...

pointer in 20019B4

call checks if 6565 or 6c6c
then 4081

finding why no english font:

80244B0 is where it converts the SJIS character to the font number
every english character returns F3
which is the dot

char<<10>>0e = char*4
added to 82F0A44 = ptr table of RL compressed character data
F3 ptr at 82F0E10
ptr table only goes up to FF
